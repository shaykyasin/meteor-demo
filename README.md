# Simple Meteor App

### Requirements

Create a simple meteor app, where a single registered user can:

* Post a message to the system - without an explicit server side call
* Delete a message they own from the system, **ONLY** using a server side call
* see a list of the messages to the system in order of the date posted.

If you need to create a signup form to do this, then do so - if not, great. 
Please also write (using mocha - preferred, jasmine, or any other framework you choose) a set of tests which you feel encompasses the criteria outlined above (Hint: should be at least 4 tests).

### Run

Make sure you have Node.js, npm/yarn and Meteor installed

Install dependencies:
```
meteor npm install
```

To view demo app:
```
npm run start
```

To run tests:
```
npm run test
```
